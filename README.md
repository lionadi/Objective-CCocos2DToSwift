This is a learning project for using Objective-C game framework Cocos2D with the new Apple Swift programming language.

The idea was to learn Cocos2D and Swift. 

This project is based mostly of the book "Learning iPhone Game Development with Cocos2D 3.0" by Kiril Muzykov - http://kirillmuzykov.com/. 
Also thanks to the following Whackylabs article for helping in setting up the Swift XCode Project:

I have removed art, sound and other media that is related to the book "Learning iPhone Game Development with Cocos2D 3.0". I have only put here code which I wrote based on the book in directly to the Swift language. The purpose of this project is to let others know how to use Cocos2D in Swift while it is in Objective-C presently. You should be able to find alot of samples how to do things with Swift while using an Objective-C library or Framework. I have also writen a few posts on issues I ran while learning Cocos2D in Swift. They may prove helpfull to someone:
